  # SC Mining Material Finder
  **The ultimate 4.6 intel tool for the elite miner.**
</div>

The Mining Material Finder is a streamlined tool built for Star Citizen 4.6 and beyond geared towards beginners and people wanting simplicity. It eliminates spreadsheet hunting so you can mine more effectively and currently clear Alliance Aid: Clearing the Air missions faster.

This is a active work in progress, I am releasing this currently as I felt it could provide some direction for beginners to mining during the event or otherwise. Improvements will continue to be made going into the future.

🕹️ HOW IT WORKS:
Choose Stanton, Pyro, or Nyx.
Select up to 3 materials (Quant, Laranite, etc).
Instantly view ranked locations with the highest combined percentages.

🚀 HUD INTELLIGENCE:
Richest locations with greatest total percentage are automatically pinned to the top.
Toggles between Surface (4000/3000) and 4.0 Orbital (4870, 4900, etc) based on location.
Identifies Q, P, and M-Type rocks before you even fire a laser.

[QUICK WARNING]
Select a specific system individually for accurate signatures; "ALL SYSTEMS" currently contains junk data. 
Avoid that section for now.
