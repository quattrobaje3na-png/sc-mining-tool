CMDR_QUATTRO // MINING MATERIAL FINDER
The user-friendly mining intelligence dashboard for Star Citizen 4.0 and beyond.

The Mining Material Finder is designed to take the complexity and memorization out of industrial scanning. No more cross-referencing spreadsheets or reaching for search engines while in the cockpit. This tool does the heavy lifting, providing a streamlined HUD for pilots who want to spend less time searching and more time hauling.

🕹️ HOW IT WORKS: THE 3-STEP SCAN
I built this tool to be the most accessible mining interface in the community. You don't need to be a data scientist to find the best ore:

1. Select Your System Choose between Stanton, Pyro, or Nyx.

2. Pick Your Targets Select up to 3 materials you want to find (e.g., Quantainium, Laranite, Bexalite).

3. Initiate Scan The tool instantly ranks every location, placing the spots with the combined largest percentages for those materials at the top of your list.


🚨 DEVELOPMENT ALERT: "ALL SYSTEMS" DATA INTEGRITY
Using the "ALL SYSTEMS" filter currently introduces junk data and duplicate location IDs. For the most accurate intelligence and correct rock signatures, please select your specific target system (Stanton, Pyro, or Nyx) individually.
This should be addressed shortly and the tool updated. 


🚀 ADVANCED HUD INTELLIGENCE
While the interface is designed for simplicity, the backend is driven by a sophisticated logic engine specifically calibrated for the Star Citizen 4.0 ecosystem. It is built to be easily updated with new information from Regolith or other data sources.

Ranked Yield Sorting The tool doesn't just list locations; it analyzes them. A mathematical weighting algorithm aggregates the probabilities of your selected materials, pinning the absolute richest clusters to the top of your HUD for maximum efficiency.

Smart Signature Detection The tool is context-aware. It automatically identifies the environment of your selected location and toggles scanning parameters accordingly. It provides specific data for both space and ground locations:

Orbital Operations: Automatically triggers for Lagrange points, RMB/RAB bases, and asteroid belts to provide specific rock-type signatures (4870, 4900, etc).

Surface Operations: Identifies planetary outposts (HDMS, HDSF) and moon-based deposits to provide standard ground signatures (4000/3000).

Precision Signature Mapping Never scan a rock blindly. The tool utilizes the latest 4.0 signature standards, allowing you to identify Q-Type, P-Type, M-Type, and specific materials based on their unique signal returns before you ever fire a mining laser.
