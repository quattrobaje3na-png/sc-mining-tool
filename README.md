I have finalized the Mining Material Finder GitHub description. This version places the official legal and community disclaimers at the bottom while emphasizing the user-friendly "System + 3 Materials" workflow at the top.

> CMDR_QUATTRO // MINING MATERIAL FINDER
The high fidelity, user-friendly mining intelligence dashboard for Star Citizen 4.0 and beyond.

The Mining Material Finder is designed to take the complexity and memorization out of industrial scanning. No more cross-referencing spreadsheets or or reaching for search engines. 
This tool does the heavy lifting, providing a streamlined HUD for pilots who want to spend less time searching and more time hauling.

🕹️ HOW IT WORKS: THE 3-STEP SCAN
I built this tool to be the most accessible mining interface in the community. You don't need to be a data scientist to find the best ore:

Select Your System: Choose between Stanton, Pyro, or Nyx.

Pick Your Targets: Select up to 3 materials you want to find (e.g., Quantainium, Laranite, Bexalite).

Initiate Scan: The tool instantly ranks every location, placing the spots with the combined largest percentages for those materials at the top of your list.

🚀 ADVANCED HUD INTELLIGENCE
While the interface is designed for simplicity, the backend is driven by a sophisticated logic engine specifically calibrated for the Star Citizen 4.0 ecosystem while easy to upgrade with new information fron Regolith or otherwise.

Ranked Yield Sorting: The tool doesn't just list locations; it analyzes them. A mathematical weighting algorithm aggregates the probabilities of your selected materials, pinning the absolute richest clusters to the top of your HUD for maximum efficiency.

Smart Signature Detection: The tool is context-aware. It automatically identifies your selected locations environment and toggles scanning parameters accordingly and provides that information for space or ground locations:

Orbital Operations: Automatically triggers for Lagrange points, RMB/RAB bases, and asteroid belts to provide specific rock-type signatures (4870, 4900, etc.).

Precision Signature Mapping: Never scan a rock blindly. The tool utilizes the latest 4.0 signature standards, allowing you to identify Q-Type, P-Type, M-Type, and specific materials based on their unique signal returns before you ever fire a mining laser.

[!NOTE]

Development Alert: Using the "ALL SYSTEMS" filter may currently introduce some junk data or duplicate IDs. For the most accurate intel, select your specific target system (Stanton, Pyro, or Nyx) individually.

🛠️ INSTALLATION & SETUP
Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/quattrobaje3na-png/sc-mining-tool.git

Verify Data: Ensure probabilities.json, ore_locations.json, and reference.json are in the root folder.

Launch: Open index.html in any browser—optimized for secondary monitors and tablets.
